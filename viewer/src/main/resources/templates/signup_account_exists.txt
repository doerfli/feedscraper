Hello!

We would like to inform you, that a new account sign up for Feedscraper was
just requested using your email address [(${email})].

If this was you who signed up again accidentally, then all is good. Otherwise
someone else tried to sign up using your email address - still not a big deal.
You can ignore this event and no further action needs to be taken from your
side, we just wanted to inform you that it happened. :-)
